"""Cross-entropy loss wrappers and dispatch.

``ForCausalLMLoss`` and ``ForSequenceClassificationLoss`` own the outer policy
(label shifting for causal LM, SP-aware reduction) and delegate the actual
cross-entropy computation to ``cross_entropy_fn`` — a single required-style
keyword argument. The wrapper decides between two paths per call: the loss
path (delegated to the bound ``cross_entropy_fn``) or — when the caller
forwards ``return_log_probs=True`` through ``forward`` kwargs — the per-token
log-probs + entropy path (delegated to ``chunk_logprobs_function``). The
choice of which loss kernel to use is still made once, at
``install_loss_mapping`` / ``KERNEL_REGISTRY.resolve`` time, and baked in via
``functools.partial``.

Wrapper return shape: ``(loss, logits, log_probs, entropy)``. The third and
fourth slots are non-``None`` only on the log-probs path; on the loss path
they are ``None`` so every model `forward` can do
``loss, _, log_probs, entropy = self.loss_function(...)`` followed by
``outputs.log_probs = log_probs; outputs.entropy = entropy`` without a
per-model branch on ``return_log_probs``.

Two dispatch paths reach these wrappers:

1. ``LOSS_MAPPING``: ``install_loss_mapping(impl)`` binds
   ``partial(ForCausalLMLoss, cross_entropy_fn=<impl>)`` (or the
   ``_chunk_loss_dispatch`` shim for the chunk_loss/npu impls) into
   ``LOSS_MAPPING["ForCausalLM"]`` etc. Models that call
   ``self.loss_function(...)`` go through this path.

2. ``KERNEL_REGISTRY`` / ``OpSlot``: the registered factories below return the
   same callable shape, bound to ``veomni_causal_lm_loss`` /
   ``veomni_seq_cls_loss`` at model-build time. Generated modeling code that
   already knows it wants a fused kernel calls the ``OpSlot`` directly.

Contract: ``apply_ops_config(ops_config)`` must run before any model is built,
otherwise ``LOSS_MAPPING`` contains HF's stock wrapper which doesn't understand
``hidden_states=``/``weights=`` kwargs. ``build_foundation_model`` owns this:
pass ``ops_implementation=...`` (trainers do) and it installs the config;
callers that omit it must have pre-installed a singleton via
``apply_ops_config`` themselves, otherwise ``build_foundation_model`` raises.

    Token-level loss for sequence classification.

    This loss follows the "token-level labels" convention:
    `labels` has the same layout as the token sequence,
    with all positions set to `ignore_index` except the supervised tokens (the last valid token of each sample).
    No shifting is applied.
    When SP is enabled, the loss is reduced across SP ranks using the number of non-ignored tokens.

    Args:
        logits (`torch.Tensor`):
            Classification logits.
        labels (`torch.Tensor`):
            Token-level labels with `ignore_index` marking non-supervised positions.
        num_labels (`int`):
            Number of classes.
        num_items_in_batch (`int`):
            Used to accurately calculate the average loss for each sample.
        ignore_index (`int`, defaults to `-100`):
            Label value to ignore when computing the loss.
        cross_entropy_fn (`Callable`):
            Inner CE kernel, pre-bound by ``install_loss_mapping`` /
            ``KERNEL_REGISTRY``. Defaults to eager for direct in-process calls
            (e.g. tests); production dispatch always provides an explicit value.
        hidden_states (`torch.Tensor`):
            Hidden states, used for fused linear cross-entropy.
        weights (`torch.Tensor`):
            Classification head weights, used for fused linear cross-entropy.

    Returns:
        loss (`torch.Tensor`):
            Scalar classification loss.
        logits (`torch.Tensor`):
            Flattened logits.
        log_probs (`None`):
            Always ``None`` for sequence classification — the third tuple slot
            exists to keep the wrapper return shape uniform with
            ``ForCausalLMLoss`` so model `forward` call sites can unpack
            ``(loss, logits, log_probs, entropy)`` regardless of head type.
        entropy (`None`):
            Always ``None`` for sequence classification — fourth slot exists
            for the same uniform-unpack reason as ``log_probs``.

    ``build_foundation_model`` before the model is constructed (so VeOmni
    modeling code that calls ``self.loss_function(hidden_states=...,

    ``ForCausalLMLoss``).

    Contract — return type: **VeOmni's wrappers return ``(loss, logits,
    log_probs, entropy)``**, not a bare ``torch.Tensor``. The 4-tuple is
    load-bearing: fused kernels (Liger fused linear+CE, NPU
    ``chunk_loss_function``) fold the ``lm_head`` projection into the loss,
    so the kernel — not the caller — is where logits come out. The third
    and fourth slots, ``log_probs`` and ``entropy``, are non-``None`` only
    on the per-token log-probs path — when the caller passes
    ``return_log_probs=True`` (and optionally ``temperature=...``) through
    ``forward`` kwargs, the wrapper short-circuits to
    ``chunk_logprobs_function`` and returns
    ``(None, None, log_probs, entropy)``. Every VeOmni-patched v5 modeling

    ``outputs.log_probs = log_probs; outputs.entropy = entropy`` so
    per-token log-probs and entropy surface on the standard ``ModelOutput``
    without a per-model early-exit branch.

    This diverges from upstream ``transformers.loss.loss_utils.ForCausalLMLoss``
    which returns a bare ``Tensor``. Mixing ``install_loss_mapping`` with
    an unpatched HF model's ``forward`` (which still does ``loss =
